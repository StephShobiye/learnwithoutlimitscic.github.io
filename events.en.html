      <h2>About our events</h2>
      <p>
        Learn Without Limits CIC runs a small programme of calm, accessible peer support events for parents in Wales,
        supporting families of children with Additional Learning Needs (ALN), disability, and long term health conditions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our events are designed to reduce isolation, support early intervention, and help prevent situations from escalating
        by giving parents time and space to think, reflect, and talk things through with others who understand.
      </p>
      <p>
        Events are delivered primarily online, with occasional in person sessions in Swansea planned later in the year.
      </p>

      <h2>Book an event</h2>
      <p>
        All upcoming events, dates, and booking details are published on Eventbrite, which we use as our booking and registration platform.
        Eventbrite is our single source of truth for dates and availability.
      </p>

      <h2>What to expect from our peer support events</h2>
      <p>
        Our peer support events provide calm, lightly facilitated spaces for reflection and connection for parents supporting children
        with additional needs or long term health conditions.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Focused on peer support and shared understanding, rather than formal training</li>
        <li>Gently structured to keep discussions respectful and contained</li>
        <li>Inclusive and accessibility-aware</li>
        <li>Grounded in lived experience and prevention of escalation</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Peer support events are one part of our wider programme of work. Training, education, and accredited learning opportunities for parents,
        young people, and professionals will be shared separately as those workstreams are launched.
      </p>

      <h2>Looking ahead</h2>
      <p>
        Alongside our regular online peer support sessions, we plan to introduce occasional in person Sunday brunch peer support sessions in Swansea city centre later in the year.
        These sessions will also be advertised and booked via Eventbrite once dates are confirmed.
      </p>

      <h2>Related resources and ongoing work</h2>
      <p>Parents who attend our events often engage with our wider work, including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Practical guidance and resources for families navigating ALN, education, safeguarding, and long term health</li>
        <li>The ALN Parent Guide App, currently in development</li>
        <li>In depth blog articles exploring common challenges faced by families in Wales</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Additional downloadable toolkits and resources will be made available later in the year as our systems are put in place.
