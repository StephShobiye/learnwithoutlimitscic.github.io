      <h1>About Learn Without Limits CIC</h1>

      <p>
        <strong>Learn Without Limits CIC</strong> is a Wales-based, parent-led Community Interest Company supporting
        children, young people and young adults with Additional Learning Needs (ALN), disabilities, and related
        education and health challenges.
      </p>

      <p>
        We help families navigate complex systems such as education, health, and social care by providing clear,
        practical information, guidance and signposting. Our focus is on early understanding and prevention —
        supporting families before issues escalate into crisis.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our work is grounded in lived experience and informed by public guidance, evidence, and an understanding
        of how systems operate in practice. We recognise that many families feel overwhelmed, unheard, or unsure
        where to turn, and we aim to provide clarity, reassurance, and practical next steps.
      </p>

      <h2>Governance, safeguarding and policies</h2>

      <p>
        Learn Without Limits CIC is committed to strong governance, safeguarding, transparency, and ethical practice.
        As a Community Interest Company, we operate with a clear public benefit purpose and recognise the responsibility
        that comes with supporting children, young people and young adults, particularly those who may be vulnerable
        or navigating complex systems.
      </p>

      <h3>Safeguarding</h3>
      <p>
        Safeguarding is a core priority across all our activities. We have clear safeguarding arrangements in place
        and expect anyone working with or representing Learn Without Limits CIC, including volunteers, to follow them.

      </p>

      <h3>Privacy and data protection</h3>
      <p>
        We take privacy and data protection seriously and are committed to handling personal data responsibly,
        proportionately, and transparently.

      </p>

      <h3>Information and professional boundaries</h3>
      <p>
        We provide information, guidance and signposting, but we are not a legal, medical, or clinical service.
        We are clear about our role and professional boundaries to ensure ethical practice and protect families.

        leadership, decision-making, and service design.

      <!-- NEW SECTION: QUARTERLY REPORTS -->

      <h2>Quarterly Reports</h2>

      <p>
        We publish short quarterly programme and governance updates so that families, supporters and stakeholders
        can follow our journey over time.
      </p>

      <p>
        Each report provides a plain-English snapshot of where we are at that point, including what work has taken
        place, what stage the programme is in, and what the current focus is. The level of activity in each quarter
        will vary depending on funding, capacity and safeguarding requirements.
