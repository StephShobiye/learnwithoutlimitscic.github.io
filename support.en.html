    <h2>Support Learn Without Limits CIC</h2>

    <p>
      Learn Without Limits CIC is building Wales-wide digital and community infrastructure 
      to improve outcomes for children and young people with Additional Learning Needs (ALN) and disabilities.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our work is preventative. We focus on reducing escalation, exclusion and crisis 
      by providing practical tools, structured guidance and community support before problems grow.
    </p>

    <p>
      We are currently unfunded and operating at an early infrastructure stage. 
      We have established our governance foundations, safeguarding framework and proof-of-concept digital tools. 
      We are now seeking structured support to enable sustainable, measurable delivery across Wales.
    </p>
