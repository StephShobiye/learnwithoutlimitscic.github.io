      <h2>Support Learn Without Limits CIC</h2>

      <p>
        Learn Without Limits CIC is building Wales-wide digital and community infrastructure to improve outcomes for children and young people with Additional Learning Needs (ALN) and disabilities.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our work is preventative. We focus on reducing escalation, exclusion and crisis by providing practical tools, structured guidance and community support before problems grow.
      </p>

      <p>
        We are currently unfunded and operating at an early infrastructure stage. We have established our governance foundations, safeguarding framework and proof-of-concept digital tools. We are now seeking structured support to enable sustainable, measurable delivery across Wales.
      </p>

      <h2>Sponsor or Partner With Us</h2>

      <p>
        We work with organisations and individuals who want to support practical, preventative solutions for families navigating education, health and employability pathways.
      </p>

      <p>Support can include:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Sponsoring defined programme activity</li>
        <li>Supporting digital infrastructure development</li>
        <li>Sponsoring community events</li>
        <li>Providing professional expertise or technical support</li>
        <li>Contributing through clearly defined, role-based volunteering</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Our volunteer team includes experienced parent carers, safeguarding-trained community moderators, educators, creative professionals, first language Welsh speakers supporting bilingual development, and individuals providing technical support.
      </p>

      <p>
        All volunteering is structured, role-based and aligned to defined programme outcomes.
      </p>

      <h2>Support Through Structured Contribution</h2>

      <p>
        We are currently finalising our online contribution and payment facilities.
      </p>
